# SSUI-Homework-4 - React JS based web app for Bun Bun Bake Shop
### Features:
 - Interactive cart hover preview on every page
 - Dynamic-loaded data from JSON file
 - Dynamic-loaded item details from React component
 - An integration of AsyncStorage (Note: npm package was somehow unable to be minified, so I modified and put them in ./src)
 - Modal-styled item detail page
 - Some css animations
